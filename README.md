# Design-of-a-32-bit-Single-Cycle-Processor-on-FPGA
This project designs a simple single-cycle CPU in Verilog with basic arithmetic operations (adder/subtractor, Knuth multiplier). Though not yet fully functional, it illustrates single-cycle datapath execution and serves as a foundation for future multi-cycle or pipelined processors.
